# Introduction

A Tufte-inspired theme for Hugo and Blogdown for Life in the Fast Lane, built by Frankenstein-ing [Hugo-Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) and [Tuftesque](https://github.com/nstrayer/tuftesque) Fontawesome. And some stuff from Gitbook, you philistines. R packages: blogdown, tinytex. Pandoc, R.utils.

All R code examples on this blog are sourced from the excellent [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/) site from [Lukas Piwek](http://www.lukaszpiwek.com/).
